# Progress Report B \- February 2025

* Attempted to change project name
  * error: app_hide.toml': No such file or directory (os error 2)
    * Resolved this error, got another about not being able to reach localhost. Decided that I wanted a refresher on the project creation process anyway.
  * New project with correct name, pushed to repo and updated its name aswell.

* Arduino setup took longer than I would've liked
  * Fedora permission issue
  * Lack of obvious documentation
    * RGB LED is pin 48...
